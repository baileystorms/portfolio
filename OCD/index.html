	Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive, unwanted, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and irrational, excessive urges to complete certain actions (compulsions). Although individuals with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors are irrational, they are often unable to stop or control them.<br><br>A diagnosis of OCD requires the presence of obsession and/or compulsions that are time-consuming, cause major distress, and impair work, social or other important function. Approximately 1.2% of Americans have OCD and among adults slightly more women than man are affected.</p>
